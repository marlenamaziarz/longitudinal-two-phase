Evaluating Longitudinal Markers under Two-phase Study Designs

This repository contains R functions, including examples, for calculating risk predictions based on a longitudinal marker in a case-cohort (CCH) or a nested case-control (NCC) sample, using methods described in **Evaluating longitudinal markers under two-phase study designs** by Marlena Maziarz, Tianxi Ci, Li Qi, Anna Lok and Yingye Zheng. The examples below illustrate the use of our methods to predict risk using PC_GLM based on a longitudinal biomarker with a survival outcome, as well as several evaluation measures of prediction and their standard error. The evaluation measures we considered are the prediction error (PE), true and false positive fractions (TPF and FPF), the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUC), the proportion of cases followed (PCF) and the proportion of cases needed to be followed (PNF).
